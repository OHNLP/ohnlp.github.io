## OHNLP Community Council

Open Health NLP is governed by the Community Council, which is constituted by members from the Open Health NLP community. The Council holds periodic meetings by phone and/or email. Agenda items may be proposed by any member.

Agenda items will be collected in advance and the Council will meet to address the items, to evaluate and address any concerns about the consortium and the community around the Project. Meeting minutes will be public and will be posted on the Open Health NLP website.

The following sections describe guidelines regarding technical roles and responsibilities and the handling of source code. Substantial enhancements or modifications of these guidelines need approval of the Community Council.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Anyone can help regardless of his or her role. The more a person becomes involved in the project, the more he or she develops a trusting relationship with others.

Open Health NLP respects the rights of its community to post messages and use mailing lists as they evolve to further the aims of the Project. In fact, we encourage interaction among the community. To this end, we will do our best to limit "spam" and to ensure that communication among community members is carried out politely and efficiently.

- **Public (anonymous)**: Anonymous users may view documentation and download code, but do not have write access to the source code and may not update this Wiki or create bug reports.
- **Member Organization**: A Member is an organization that is engaged in the OHNLP consortium. The Community Council will consist of representatives from Member Organizations.
- **Participant**: A participant refers to an individual that is registered (is not anonymous). A participant may be part of a Member Organization or may be independent. A participant is allowed to create bug reports and to update this Wiki.
- **Contributors**: Contributors refer to those who are Participants of a Open Health NLP project who write code, documentation, extensions or otherwise contribute positively to the Project.
- **Developers**: Developers are contributors who have write access to the source code repository.
- **Project Administrators**: Administrators can release a pipeline (subproject), create new release packages and can promote Contributors to Developers. Administrators can also give specific authorities to members as appropriate.


## Creating or contributing a new project

Developers wishing to create a new subproject should contact a Project Administrator with a suggested name and a brief summary of the subproject. The Developer will need to specify which license the subproject is contributed under. The Open Health NLP encourages the use of the Apache 2.0 license.

In addition, the Developer will need to provide documentation for the subproject, including how to compile/modify the source and how to install, configure and run the code.
